Smart Journal is a shiny application (an app) i have written that helps with finding correlations between your: 
-lifestyle. Such as food, sleep, good/bad habits, etc.
-results. Such as goals, allergies, stamina, energy, stress, fitness etc. (positive or negative)

This app lets you input these on a daily basis and shows you dynamic graphs with findings.

Works online, on any device that has internet, any time.

I have made the code available, feel free to take a look.
The app is not usable at this point for I've hidden the info needed for connecting to the underlying mysql database.

ToDo:
-Clean up the code
-add some images with examples
-Create some dummy data and host it online, so that people can see how it looks/works.
-Make it publicly available for use with some kind of login.
